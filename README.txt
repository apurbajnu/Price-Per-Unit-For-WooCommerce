== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does This Plugin work with all types of products =

You can easily configure the Simple product with the free version. To configure variable products, I will suggest you go with the pro version. 

= How to setup Price  =

Remember this plugin calculates the price is not related to the regular price or sale price from the General tab. WooCommerce product price only shows the product price value. You may show the minimum value with the WooCommerce product price.

If you want to sell Rope 7 USD per meter then in the responsibilities field add 1|7, that's it. It means 1 meter or above 1-meter price will be 7 USD per meter. For 3 meter price will be 21 Usd. But if you want to sell a product with a different price for a different length then in the responsibilities field you can set the price like this 20|15,50|12,70|9,100|7.

= What is the difference between Slider View and Numeric View  =

 Slider view gives the ability to select the product quantity with sliding. With the numeric view, your audience will get a numeric input field to select the product quantity. 

To use the slider view, you have to fill the min and max quantity fields. It should have a range. For the Numeric view, Max quantity is not important.
