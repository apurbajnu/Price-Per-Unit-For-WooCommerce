== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does This Plugin work with all types of products. =

You can easily configure the Simple product with the free version. To configure variable products, I will suggest you go with the pro version. 

= What is the difference between Slider View and Numeric View =

 Slider view gives the ability to select the product quantity with sliding. With the numeric view, your audience will get a numeric input field to select the product quantity. 

To use the slider view, you have to fill the min and max quantity fields. It should have a range. For the Numeric view, Max quantity is not important.
